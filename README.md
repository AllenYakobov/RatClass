# RatClass

Rat Class contains fuctions operator+, operator-, operator*, operator/ that teaches the compiler how to perform arithmetic operations on rational numbers (numerator/denominator). 
operator>> teaches the compiler how to take a fraction as an input, and operator<< teaches the compiler how to print the answer in function form (numerator/denominator)

ex.
If
Rat 1: 1 3/4
Rat 2: 1 3/5

Output:
Rat 1 + Rat 2 = 2 7/20
Rat 1 - Rat 2 = 3/20
Rat 1 * Rat 2 = 1/20
Rat 1 / Rat 2 = 11/12
